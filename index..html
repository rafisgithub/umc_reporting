            <div class="section">
                <p>However, UMC staff and Mr. Majedul Saheb have raised the following concerns:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="issue" style="cursor: pointer;"> Printing Issue:</li>
                    <p class="suggestion" style="display: none;">They and include me facing printing issue.Software can't make perfectly pdf for printing(Data is duplicating automatically).where one page is enough for showing result there create six pages and showing every page bottom calculation result.</p>

                    <li class="issue" style="cursor: pointer;">Card Room Entrance Fee:</li>
                    <p class="suggestion" style="display: none;">Card room->In entrance fee adding all infos when click save button data save perfectly saved into the database but returning a blank page.</p>

                    <li class="issue" style="cursor: pointer;"> Total Game and Amount Calculation:</li>
                    <p class="suggestion" style="display: none;">Total game and Amount (Calculation part)->in the above member id showing also on calculation part(it's Unnecesary).</p>

                    <li class="issue" style="cursor: pointer;">Game Input Optimization:</li>
                    <p class="suggestion" style="display: none;">If one game is playing 25 times. In software, you have to input 25 times. But they want it to be able to take input once like (game name * 25).</p>

                    <li class="issue" style="cursor: pointer;">Most important:</li>
                    <p class="suggestion" style="display: none;">They need a UMC member ID input option (There are so many reasons; I can explain if needed).</p>
                </ol>
            </div>
